This project comes from stats from the 2024 WNBA players' totals. The analyses ran shows: 
- how many players were on the 2024 roster
- a table of the players, minutes played, and three-point shooting percentage
- a graph of the distribution of three-point shooting percentages
- a highlighted player in a graph to show their place in the shooting percentage distribution

This data comes from: https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/years/2024_totals.html

To reproduce this data: 
- create a subset of the three main variables being observed
- create a histogram or other visual graph of players' 3P shooting percentage
- create a graph/visual highlighting a specific player's stats among other players
